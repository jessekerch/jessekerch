### Hi! I'm Jesse. ğŸ‘‹ 

I'm a full stack software engineer based in Los Angeles, CA.
I use my experience in international wholesales to write efficient, maintainable code and simplify complex problems.
Recently, I created [Harrier](https://harrier.github.io/), an open-source tool for setting up self-hosted GitHub Actions runners and persistent cache in your AWS cloud.
