### Hi! I'm Jesse. ğŸ‘‹ 

I'm a full stack software engineer based in Los Angeles, CA. I use my past experience in international logistics and consulting to quickly break down and contribute to codebases, simplify complex systems, and stay highly organized.

Recently, I created [Harrier](https://harrier.github.io/), an open-source tool for setting up self-hosted GitHub Actions runners and persistent cache in your AWS cloud.
